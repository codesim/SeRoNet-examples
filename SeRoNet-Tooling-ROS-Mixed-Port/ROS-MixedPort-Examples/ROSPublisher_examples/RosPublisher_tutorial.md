# ROS Publisher relay to SeRoNet network

Short description

Some of the concepts explained in [SeRoNet Tooling Collection - ROS support](../../README.md) are required to perform this tutorial.

#### System overview

#### Required packages

**Domain Models projects::**

- CommBacicObjects

- ROSCommon_msgs

- ROSRos_core

**ROS projects:**

- de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.communication.objects

- joy

**Component model projects:**

- ComponentRosjoy_node (it will be created in this tutorial)


#### ROS components

For this example we selected one of the most common ROS driver, the [joy package](http://wiki.ros.org/joy) , a package that requires as dependency the [sensor_msgs](http://wiki.ros.org/sensor_msgs). As it is part of the common ROS msgs the required dependencies can be automatically loaded using the ROS workspace setup button, remember that this menu is only for the ROS developer perspective available:
