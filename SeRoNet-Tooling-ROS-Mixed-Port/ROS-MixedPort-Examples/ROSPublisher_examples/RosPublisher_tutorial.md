# ROS Publisher relay to SeRoNet network

Short description

Some of the concepts explained in [SeRoNet Tooling Collection - ROS support](../../README.md) are required to perform this tutorial. A previous default setup of the workspace is necesary to follow the instructions of the tutorial: [WORKSPACE SETUP](../ROSMixedPortTutorials_WSsetup.md).

#### System overview

![SystemOverview](images/rospub_diagram.png)

#### Required packages

**Domain Models projects::**

- CommBacicObjects

- ROSCommon_msgs

- ROSRos_core

**ROS projects:**

- de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.communication.objects

- joy

**Component model projects:**

- ComponentRosjoy_node (it will be created in this tutorial)


#### ROS components

For this example we selected one of the most common ROS driver, the [joy package](http://wiki.ros.org/joy), a package that requires as dependency the [sensor_msgs](http://wiki.ros.org/sensor_msgs). As it is part of the common ROS msgs the required dependencies were automatically loaded to your workspace whitin the project **de.fraunhofer.ipa.ros.communication.objects**.
