	Description : "This component is a so called Mixed-Port component that interacts with two different frameworks. 
		On the one side, this component provides a JoystickServiceOut service that pushes Joystick messages to other components.
		On the other side, this component interacts with a ROS system to access the Joystick driver implement as a ROS node.\n
		\n
		For using the component, the ROS Joystick node needs to be started as follows:\n
		> rosrun joy joy_node\n
		for further details o how to operate the ROS Joystick, see: http://wiki.ros.org/joy/Tutorials/ConfiguringALinuxJoystick"
