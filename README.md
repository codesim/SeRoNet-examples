# SeRoNet-examples

This repository holds examples created with the **SeRoNet Tooling Collection**. The examples can be created from scratch by following the instructions provided in the example folders. Alternatively, the final code of examples can be downloaded by cloning this repository:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/seronet-project/SeRoNet-examples.git
```

This repository consists of the following examples:

* **[SeRoNet-Tooling-Hello-World](SeRoNet-Tooling-Hello-World)**: this is a very simple entry level example demonstrating the fundamental core features of the SeRoNet Tooling and is a good starting point to get familiar with the tooling
* **[SeRoNet-Tooling-OPCUA-Backend](SeRoNet-Tooling-OPCUA-Backend)**: this example builds on the first example and demonstrates an important feature of the SeRoNet Tooling that allows switching the underlying middleware easily
* **[SeRoNet-Tooling-ROS-Mixed-Port](SeRoNet-Tooling-ROS-Mixed-Port)**: this example demonstartes the so called ROS MixedPort functionality of the SeRoNet Tooling

These examples can be used as a starting point to get familiar with the basic features of the SeRoNet Tooling Collection. We also provide further **[Online Tutorials](https://wiki.servicerobotik-ulm.de/tutorials:start)** that go deeper and focus more on specific robotics use-cases.
