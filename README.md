# SeRoNet Tooling

The [SeRoNet project](https://www.seronet-projekt.de) provides model-driven tools for the various stakeholders around the SeRoNet Mediation Platform. These support providers and users of components in all development, selection and implementation steps.

The SeRoNet tooling allows to connect different frameworks, its current implementation includes: SmartSoft, OPC-UA and ROS.

This repository holds examples created with the **SeRoNet Tooling Collection**. The examples can be created from scratch by following the instructions provided in the example folders. Alternatively, the final code of examples can be downloaded by cloning this repository:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/seronet-project/SeRoNet-examples.git
```

This repository consists of the following examples:

* **[SeRoNet-Tooling-Hello-World](SeRoNet-Tooling-Hello-World)**: this is a very simple entry level example demonstrating the fundamental core features of the SeRoNet Tooling and is a good starting point to get familiar with the tooling
* **[SeRoNet-Tooling-OPCUA-Backend](SeRoNet-Tooling-OPCUA-Backend)**: this example builds on the first example and demonstrates an important feature of the SeRoNet Tooling that allows switching the underlying middleware easily
* **[SeRoNet-Tooling-ROS-Mixed-Port](SeRoNet-Tooling-ROS-Mixed-Port)**: this example demonstrates the so called ROS MixedPort functionality of the SeRoNet Tooling

These examples can be used as a starting point to get familiar with the basic features of the SeRoNet Tooling Collection. We also provide further **[Online Tutorials](https://wiki.servicerobotik-ulm.de/tutorials:start)** that go deeper and focus more on specific robotics use-cases.
